The effect of various exhaust geometries on system back-pressure and noise results were investigated, along with the effect of an argon purge on weld quality. Major material failures are documented, as well as the nature of the degradation of absorptive material in the mufflers. This report also contains some details on avenues of study which were unable to be completed due to resource limitations or the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\n## heading size 2\nThis project includes a broad range of work and various investigations in the pursuit of improving the understanding of and techniques involved in designing and fabricating a high-performance Formula SAE/Formula Student exhaust system.\n\nA stainless steel manifold and two double-pass absorptive mufflers were designed, manufactured and tested.
